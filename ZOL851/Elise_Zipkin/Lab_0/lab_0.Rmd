==========================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **?** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(LakeHuron)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(LakeHuron)
```

For this assignment, please change the above chunks to the data set "LakeHuron". Don't forget to commit and push the changes to GitHub. 

Due today in-class.

**GRADER: Looks good! (Pass)**
